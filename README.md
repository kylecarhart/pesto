## Ingredients

- ¼ cup (30 grams) pine nuts
- 5 medium clove garlic, peeled
- 2 cups (70 grams) tightly packed basil leaves, preferably Genovese
- ⅔ cup (60 grams) finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
- ⅓ cup (30 grams) finely grated Pecorino Romano
- Sea salt
- Extra-virgin olive oil (as needed)

## Steps

1. In a mortar and pestle, grind nuts and garlic into a paste while adding a
   pinch or two of kosher salt.
2. Add basil leaves to the mortar and grind to a very smooth paste (take your time).
3. Add the paste to a large bowl and combine with grated parmesan and pecorino cheese.
4. Finally, add extra-virgin olive oil to your desired consistency.

## Preserving

I have found that half pint (8oz) mason jars are the ideal size for a pound of pasta and giving as gifts.

1. Place the pesto in the jar.
2. Top the jar with a small layer of olive oil.
3. Seal the lid and place in the freezer.

Thaw the jar in warm water when ready to use.

**Pesto will turn brown when left in the open air for too long. Seal the jar whenever possible.**
